The `main.tsx` file serves as the entry point for your Reysin application. It initializes the Reysin framework and sets up the root React component.

## Basic Usage

Here's a typical `main.tsx` file for a Reysin application:

```typescript jsx
import { type AppContainer, Reysin, ReysinApp } from "@reysin/project";
import React from "react";

new Reysin((container: AppContainer) => {
  return (
   <React.StrictMode>
    <ReysinApp container={container} />
   </React.StrictMode>
  );
});
```

Let's break down this code:

1. We import necessary components from the Reysin framework and React.
2. We create a new instance of the `Reysin` class, which initializes our application.
3. The `Reysin` constructor takes a function as an argument. This function receives an `AppContainer` and returns the root React component.
4. We wrap our `ReysinApp` component with `React.StrictMode` for additional development checks.
5. The `ReysinApp` component receives the `container` as a prop, which will be used to manage the application's state and dependencies.

## Key Components

- `Reysin`: The main class that bootstraps your application.
- `AppContainer`: A container that manages your application's dependencies and state.
- `ReysinApp`: The root component of your Reysin application.
