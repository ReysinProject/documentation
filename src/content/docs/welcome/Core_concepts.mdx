Reysin is built around several key concepts that form its architecture and guide application development. Understanding these concepts will help you make the most of the framework.

## Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

Reysin adopts the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which clearly separates the user interface logic, facilitating the development and maintenance of applications.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Model" icon="document">
    Represents the data and business logic of your application.
  </Card>
  <Card title="View" icon="open-book">
    Responsible for displaying data to the user.
  </Card>
  <Card title="ViewModel" icon="random">
    Acts as an intermediary layer between models and views.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Model

Models represent the data and business logic of your application. They are independent of the user interface and can be reused in different parts of your application.

Example of a model:

```typescript
export class User {
  constructor(
    public id: string,
    public name: string,
    public email: string
  ) {}
}
```

### View

Views are responsible for displaying data to the user. In Reysin, views are typically React components that receive data via props and emit events.

Example of a view:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { User } from '../models/User';
import { observer } from '@reysin/project'

interface UserViewProps {
  user: User;
  onUpdateUser: (user: User) => void;
}

export const UserView: React.FC<UserViewProps> = observer(({ user, onUpdateUser }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
      <button onClick={() => onUpdateUser(user)}>Update User</button>
    </div>
  );
});
```

### ViewModel

ViewModels act as an intermediary layer between models and views. They contain the presentation logic and handle user interactions.

Example of a ViewModel:

```typescript
import { transient } from 'reysin';
import { User } from '../models/User';
import { UserService } from '../services/UserService';

@transient()
export class UserViewModel {
  private _user: User | null = null;

  constructor(private userService: UserService) {}

  async loadUser(id: string): Promise<void> {
    this._user = await this.userService.getUser(id);
  }

  get user(): User | null {
    return this._user;
  }

  updateUser(updatedUser: User): void {
    this.userService.updateUser(updatedUser);
    this._user = updatedUser;
  }
}
```

## Service Management

Reysin uses a dependency injection system to manage services. Services are singleton classes that encapsulate business logic and data operations.

```typescript
import { singleton } from 'reysin';
import { User } from '../models/User';

@singleton()
export class UserService {
  private users: User[] = [];

  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User | undefined> {
    // Simulating an API request
    return this.users.find(user => user.id === id);
  }

  async updateUser(updatedUser: User): Promise<void> {
    // Simulating an API update
    const index = this.users.findIndex(user => user.id === updatedUser.id);
    if (index !== -1) {
      this.users[index] = updatedUser;
    }
  }
}
```

## IoC Container

Reysin uses an Inversion of Control (IoC) container to manage dependencies. This allows for better modularity and testability of your code.

:::tip[Automatic Bootstrapping]
All the dependencies are automatically bootstrapped when the application is started.

## Integrated CLI

Reysin provides a powerful CLI to quickly generate components, services, and ViewModels. This helps maintain a consistent project structure.

<Steps>
1. Open your terminal in the project root.
2. Run the Reysin CLI command to generate the desired component:
   ```bash
   reysin generate component UserList
   ```
3. The CLI will create the necessary files and update any related configurations.
4. Repeat for other components, services, or ViewModels as needed:
   ```bash
   reysin generate service AuthService
   reysin generate viewmodel ProductViewModel
   ```
</Steps>

## Strong Typing with TypeScript

Reysin is fully written in TypeScript and encourages the use of strict types to improve code quality and reduce errors.

## Based on Vite

Reysin uses Vite as a bundler, offering fast compilation times and excellent support for modern development.
